**DOMAIN**:UI/UX,FIGMA
**DURATION**:4 WEEKS
**MENTOR**:NEELA SANTOSH
**DESCRIPTION**:For this project, the aim is to explore two or three variations of a logo using Figma, a popular design tool that provides flexibility and efficiency in designing graphical elements. Below, I'll outline the process of creating mockups for the logo, considering both the design philosophy and the technical execution in Figma.
Understanding the Brand Vision:Before diving into design, it’s crucial to define the brand's core values, purpose, and audience. A logo is the face of a brand and needs to resonate with its mission. For instance, if we’re designing a logo for a smart dustbin project incorporating GSM technology and servo motors, the logo should reflect themes of technology, sustainability, and innovation.Sketching Initial Ideas
Before heading to Figma, brainstorming and sketching ideas on paper or a whiteboard can be beneficial. For this project, I envision the following key elements:
Technology Symbolism: Incorporating visuals like circuits, antennas, or wireless signals to symbolize GSM technology.
Eco-Friendly Imagery: Using icons like leaves, recycling symbols, or nature-inspired motifs to emphasize sustainability.
Mechanical Components: A subtle reference to servo motors, perhaps with circular or gear-like designs.
reating Mockups in Figma
With the ideas in mind, I proceed to Figma to create two or three logo variations:
Variation 1: Tech-Inspired Minimalism
This design focuses on a sleek and modern look. The logo includes a dustbin icon integrated with a wireless signal emanating from its lid, representing the GSM technology. To maintain minimalism, geometric shapes (e.g., circles and rectangles) are used. The color scheme combines green (for sustainability) with blue (for technology and reliability). A sans-serif font complements the modern feel of the design.
Variation 2: Eco-Focused DesignThis version emphasizes the environmental aspect of the smart dustbin. The logo features a leaf overlapping with the outline of a dustbin, signifying eco-friendliness and recycling. To create a balanced and soft appearance, I use rounded shapes and earthy tones like green, brown, and light blue. The typography is slightly curved to enhance the approachable and sustainable theme.
Variation 3: Dynamic and Industrial LookThe third variation highlights the mechanical and engineering side of the project. The logo uses a gear symbol merged with a dustbin icon to signify the servo motor technology. A bold and industrial-style font is paired with a color palette of dark gray, green, and orange. The overall aesthetic is dynamic, catering to an audience interested in technological innovation.Once the variations are complete, I will review them for scalability, simplicity, and relevance to the brand. Feedback from stakeholders can help refine the designs further. Ultimately, the chosen logo will be exported in multiple formats (e.g., SVG, PNG) for various use cases.By exploring these variations, the final logo will not only represent the core values of the smart dustbin project but also leave a memorable impression on its audience.Elements: Include a wireless signal (indicating smart technology) above the lid and a recycle symbol within the bin.
Font: Modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat) for the text "SmartBins
